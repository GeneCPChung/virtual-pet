10-6
- Created README file.
- Started on instance variables

TODO List
- Game loops are based on updating the game on a fixed or variable time span. Given the simplicity of the game, I decided to stick with a basic "do/while" loop until I can figure out a better (but still simple) way of doing it.
- Found out what a "Tick method" was and created it using "-/+ =" to increment the stats by 1 whenever an option is entered.
  - UPDATE: I'm thinking about changing this to something else but have not figured out what. I'll probably do something like update random stats or something like that. 
- Added welcome message and ability to name your pet
- Created stats list
  - Hunger
  - Boredom
  - Need to Potty
  - Sleepy

- Set the instance variables to increase/decrease specific stats whenever and option is entered.
  - So far, these were pretty simple to do, but I would love to modify these to something else.  

Optional Stretch Items

10/7/2017
- Added pictures of pets (created separate class to call the individual pictures)
  - Created additional pets and let the user choose which they wanted and created pictures for each one.
- I thought about creating a random number generator to change a random stat by x amount every iteration, but still need to figure it out.
  - Created rngNum1 and rngNum2 to effect the amount a particular action happened and how much the ticker is effected
