- Created README file.
- Started on instance variables

TODO List
- Game loops are based on updating the game on a fixed or variable time span. Given the simplicity of the game, I decided to stick with a basic "do/while" loop until I can figure out a better (but still simple) way of doing it.
- Found out what a "Tick method" was and created it using "-/+ =" to increment the stats by 1 whenever an option is entered.
  - UPDATE: I'm thinking about changing this to something else but have not figured out what. 
  I'll probably do something like update random stats or something like that.
  - UPDATE2: I tried to add randomization to the individual objects, but had too much of a hard time figuring out, so just went with random numbers assigned to each variable. 
- Added welcome message and ability to name your pet
- Created stats list
  - Hunger
  - Boredom
  - Need to Potty
  - Sleepy

- Set the instance variables to increase/decrease each stat whenever an option is entered.
  - So far, these were pretty simple to do, but I would love to modify these to something else.
  - UPDATE: Added "if" statements to include going over/below a specific number.  

Optional Stretch Items


- Added pictures of pets (created separate class to call the individual pictures)
  - Added additional pets and let the user choose which they wanted and created pictures for each one.
    - Added "deadPet" pictures when a user killed their pet. Currently only two ways to do this. The other two options attempt to correct themselves
